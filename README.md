You kill monsters in a single slash. Your goal is to score as high as possible in 60 seconds.

You have three actions: 
- Press **D** or **F** to **move toward the monster**. 
- Press **J** to slash **purple monsters**. 
- Press **K** to slash **orange monsters**.

If you **slash into empty space**, you die. If you **move onto a monster**, you die.

Be quick, be precise â€” one mistake and it's game over.
