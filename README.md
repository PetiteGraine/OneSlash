You kill monsters in a single slash. Your goal is to score as high as possible in 60 seconds.

You have three actions: 
- Move — Press D or F to change position. 
- SlashA — Press J to slash white monsters. 
- SlashB — Press K to slash orange monsters.
  
Be quick, be precise — one mistake and it's game over.
